# 阴 (Yīn)
Yin (阴) is a ML language that compiles to GLSL designed for livecoding. 
Inspired by [Renaissance](https://github.com/chadaustin/renaissance), created following [Write You a Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/).

Many functions in the standard library are ported from [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) and [Hydra](https://ojack.xyz/articles/hydra/index.html)
